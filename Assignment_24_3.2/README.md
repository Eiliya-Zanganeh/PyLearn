Threading in Python refers to the capability of a program to execute multiple threads concurrently. A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process. By using threads, a Python program can perform multiple tasks simultaneously, thereby improving performance and responsiveness, especially in tasks that involve I/O operations or blocking operations.

Python provides a built-in threading module, which allows developers to create and manage threads easily. With the threading module, you can create threads, start them, pause them, resume them, and synchronize their execution.
